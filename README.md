# Embedded Dashboard with Navigation
This Looker extension framework application provides navigation for embedded dashboards via a collapsible navigation sidebar. An admin Looker user can define navigation tabs (which correspond to Looker folders) by clicking the `Admin` button on the bottom left, and the application retrieves all the dashboards within each folder to populate the navigation sidebar.

Additional configuration options in the admin pane include:
- Sorting the dashboards under each tab
- Add nested tabs under a tab (one level of nesting)
- Hide/show the App bar
- Change the app logo
- Hide/show filters within the embedded dashboards

The admin button and configuration pane are only visible to users with the Looker `Admin` role.

This template was set up with the [create-looker-extension](https://github.com/looker-open-source/create-looker-extension) utility. It uses React and [Material-UI](https://mui.com/).
